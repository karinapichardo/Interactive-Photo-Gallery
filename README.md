# Interactive-Photo-Gallery

Created an interactive, searchable gallery of photos. 

At the top of the page, there’s a search area where photos will update in realtime depending on what the user types. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. There’s also a “back” and “previous” arrow to cycle through photos.

Technologies used: 

HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JAVASCRIPT
